			Done a small project in science fair conducted in my school when i was in 5th class. The project was related to pollution of environment.Two of the major pollututants are air pollutant and land pollutants.
			Air pollutants are majorly released due to harmful emissions from the vehicles.Also other pollutant is plastic bags and covers which are used in daily purposes.Instead jute bags can be used for daily purposes.
